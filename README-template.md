## My process

It took me longer than usual. Overall, it was awesome to sit down and start building the component from gorund. I had some hard time with the layouts, but I am happy I got to learn from that.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

I am really happy with all the process I went through. I was able to practice basic, intermidate concepts of building an UX/UI component. There were some keypoints of the challenge that were really interesting. #1, it was like bilding two components in one, or let say it was one component devided in two. Making the correct layout either on desktop or on mobile was really funny due to that. On the other hand, the internal lay out was also a challenge. Normally, I would distribute everything using flexbox. However, this time I had to pllay with some attributions on CSS3 in order to make the internal elements of the component look as similar as possible to the mockup.

### Continued development

I want to continue learning some keypoints of front end develompnet, next time I will try something bigger, like a landing page.
